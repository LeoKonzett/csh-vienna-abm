Repository for agend-based modelling of stone-age economics for a project with CSH Vienna

This is the code for an 8 weeks long project at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna under supervision of Daniel Kondor. 
We implement an agent-based model to simulate population dynamics in neolithic Europe. A detailed and precise documentation is available at (add link to Overleaf)

The notebook file illustrates how to use the code. If here are any question, please address in this GitHub and I will answer asap.
